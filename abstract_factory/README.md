    7. Abstract Factory (Creational): As an analyst in charge of designing the Decathlon POS Software, you realize the need to streamline the creation of objects belonging to different products in the Decathlon store. There are two major categories of products: 
a) For differently abled sports enthusiasts
b) For able-bodied sports enthusiasts
In each of the above categories there are products for outdoor adventure sports (e.g. trekking, para-gliding, bungee-jumping etc.), outdoor regular games (cricket, football, baseball etc.) indoor regular games (table tennis, squash etc.). There is a possibility of further class/object instantiation explosion with categories such as male & female sports enthusiasts and different equipment for them. Objects need to be instantiated based on these categories. 

Design & implement using Abstract Factory.
